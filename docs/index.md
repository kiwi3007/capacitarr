# Capacitarr

**Capacitarr** is an intelligent media library capacity manager. It monitors disk usage across your media servers and automatically identifies content for cleanup when storage runs low — using a preference-based scoring engine instead of rigid rules.

## How It Works

1. **Connect your integrations** — Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Tautulli, and Overseerr.
2. **Disk groups are auto-detected** — Capacitarr tracks capacity per root folder across your integrations.
3. **Set a threshold** — choose when cleanup should trigger (e.g., disk ≥ 85%).
4. **Adjust preference sliders** — tell the engine what you value (watch history, file size, rating, etc.).
5. **Add protection rules** — mark content as untouchable based on quality, tags, genre, or any other property.
6. **Preview or automate** — see exactly what would be deleted before anything happens, or let the engine run automatically.
