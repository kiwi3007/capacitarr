**Capacitarr** is an intelligent media library capacity manager. It monitors disk usage across your media servers and automatically identifies content for cleanup when storage runs low — using a preference-based scoring engine instead of rigid rules.

## How It Works

1. **Connect your integrations** — Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Tautulli, Jellystat, and Seerr (Overseerr/Jellyseerr).
2. **Disk groups are auto-detected** — Capacitarr tracks capacity per root folder across your integrations.
3. **Set a threshold** — choose when cleanup should trigger (e.g., disk ≥ 85%).
4. **Adjust preference sliders** — tell the engine what you value (watch history, file size, rating, etc.).
5. **Add protection rules** — mark content as untouchable based on quality, tags, genre, or any other property.
6. **Preview or automate** — see exactly what would be deleted before anything happens, or let the engine run automatically.

## Quick Start

```yaml
services:
  capacitarr:
    image: ghentstarshadow/capacitarr:stable
    container_name: capacitarr
    ports:
      - "2187:2187"
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - JWT_SECRET=change-me-to-a-random-string
    volumes:
      - capacitarr-config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  capacitarr-config:
```

Then open `http://localhost:2187` in your browser to complete setup.

### 🐾 Support Animal Rescue

Capacitarr is free software. The creator strongly prefers that donations go to animal rescue over developer support:

- **[UAnimals](https://uanimals.org/en/)** — rescuing and protecting animals in Ukraine 🇺🇦
- **[ASPCA](https://www.aspca.org/ways-to-help)** — preventing cruelty to animals
