# Sunset Deletion with Media Server Labels & Poster Overlays

**Status:** 📋 Investigative / Draft
**Scope:** Capacitarr 3.x (breaking change: per-disk-group execution modes)
**Created:** 2026-03-28

---

## Overview

Users want the ability to mark media for deletion after a configurable time frame (typically 30 days), with two key visual feedback mechanisms:

1. **Media server labels** — a configurable label/tag (default: `capacitarr-sunset`) applied to items in the media server (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby) when they enter the sunset queue. Users can then build their own smart collections, filters, or playlists from this label however they choose.
2. **Poster overlays** — a "Leaving in X days" countdown badge rendered onto media posters in the media server, similar to Netflix's "Last day to watch" banners

The term **"sunset"** is used internally to describe the countdown/deferral lifecycle. The `SunsetService` manages the transition period before removal — it does not perform deletions itself. When a sunset countdown expires, the item is handed to the existing `DeletionService` for actual removal.

---

## Design Decisions Record

| Decision | Resolution | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Execution mode scope** | Per-disk-group (not global) | Each disk group runs independently in its own mode. Eliminates the conflict between global mode and per-group overrides. 3.0 breaking change. |
| **Mode options** | `dry-run`, `approval`, `auto`, `sunset` — four peers on `DiskGroup.Mode` | Sunset is a first-class execution mode, not an overlay/modifier on other modes. Each group has exactly one behavior. |
| **Sunset data storage** | Dedicated `sunset_queue` table | Sunset items have a fundamentally different lifecycle from approval items (time-driven vs. user-action-driven, not reconciled, not cleared on threshold drop). Shared table creates behavioral complexity that compounds across every service and query. |
| **Service naming** | `SunsetService` (not `ScheduledDeletionService`) | The service manages the *transition period* before removal, not the deletion itself |
| **Poster overlay approach** | Server-side image composition | Full control over visual output; works with all three media servers; Go `image` stdlib is mature |
| **Media server visibility** | Labels/tags (not managed collections) | Simpler implementation (2-method `LabelManager` vs 5-method `CollectionManager`); users control how labels are displayed; no cross-item state to manage in the media server; less opinionated |
| **Sunset label** | Configurable, default `"capacitarr-sunset"` | Namespaced (won't collide with user labels), lowercase-kebab (consistent across Plex/Jellyfin/Emby), self-descriptive. Static label set once on entry, removed on cancel/expire — no daily churn. |
| **Threshold ordering** | `sunsetPct < targetPct < thresholdPct` | Escalation only frees down to `targetPct` (above sunset threshold), preserving the sunset queue. Items promised "leaving in 20 days" keep their promise unless things get catastrophic. |
| **`sunsetPct` default** | `NULL` (not 0) | A default of 0 is dangerous — every engine cycle would see `usedPct >= 0%` and start sunsetting immediately. NULL means sunset mode won't activate until the user explicitly configures the threshold. Engine publishes a warning event if mode is `sunset` but `sunsetPct` is NULL. |
| **TEXT for mode/status columns** | TEXT with Go-level validation (not SQL ENUM/CHECK) | SQLite has no native ENUM type. All constrained string fields in the codebase use the same pattern. CHECK constraints could be added project-wide as a separate effort. |
| **Global `ExecutionMode`** | Renamed to `DefaultMode` on `PreferenceSet`; used only as default for new disk group creation | Existing global mode migrates to each disk group at upgrade time |
| **Per-disk-group rules** | Deferred to separate plan | Rules are currently per-integration; scoring weights are global. Per-disk-group weight overrides are a legitimate need but independent of sunset. Sunset works correctly with global scoring. |

---

## The Threshold Problem and Solution

### The Core Tension

Capacitarr's current model is **reactive** — disk hits threshold, engine fires, items are deleted to reach target. A 30-day sunset countdown directly contradicts this: the disk stays full for 30 days, *arr apps stop downloading, and users lose the capacity management Capacitarr exists to provide.

### Solution: Sunset as a Pre-Threshold Mode

Sunset mode operates at a **lower threshold** (`sunsetPct`) than the deletion threshold (`thresholdPct`), giving items a warning period *before* space is critically needed. The deletion threshold is preserved as an escalation safety net.

The threshold ordering for sunset mode is `sunsetPct < targetPct < thresholdPct`:

```
Disk usage (sunset-mode disk group):
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
0%       75%        90%         95%       100%
          ^           ^           ^
       Sunset      Target      Threshold
       (NEW)      (existing)   (existing, now escalation)
```

- **75% (sunset threshold):** Engine evaluates, selects candidates, places them in `sunset_queue` with a 30-day countdown. A `capacitarr-sunset` label is applied to items in the media server. Poster overlays show "Leaving in 30 days." No bytes are freed yet.
- **75–90% (sunset → target):** Normal operation. Sunset items are counting down. Daily cron processes expiries, handing them to `DeletionService`, gradually freeing space. Disk usage fluctuates in this zone.
- **90% (target):** The "healthy" level after escalation. Not a trigger — just the ceiling that escalation frees down to.
- **95% (threshold / escalation trigger):** If disk reaches this despite active sunsets (e.g., heavy download period), the engine escalates. Force-expires sunset items, but **only enough to get back to 90% (target)**. Sunset items below 90% are preserved — users who were told "leaving in 20 days" keep their promise.

### Why `sunsetPct < targetPct < thresholdPct`

The earlier draft had `targetPct < sunsetPct < thresholdPct`, which meant escalation would try to free space all the way down to `targetPct` (below the sunset threshold) — wiping the entire sunset queue every time escalation fires. The corrected ordering ensures escalation is proportionate: it only clears the *excess* above `targetPct`, not the entire sunset queue.

### Escalation Ladder (Sunset-Mode Groups Only)

When a sunset-mode disk group breaches the deletion threshold while sunset items exist:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    BREACH["Disk exceeds thresholdPct<br/>while sunset items exist"]
    STEP1["1. Delete expired sunset items<br/>(countdown already finished)"]
    STEP2["2. Delete oldest sunset items<br/>(longest in queue, most warning given)"]
    STEP3["3. Normal immediate deletion<br/>(score-based, no sunset)"]
    CHECK1{Freed to targetPct?}
    CHECK2{Freed to targetPct?}

    BREACH --> STEP1
    STEP1 --> CHECK1
    CHECK1 -->|"No"| STEP2
    CHECK1 -->|"Yes"| DONE["Done"]
    STEP2 --> CHECK2
    CHECK2 -->|"No"| STEP3
    CHECK2 -->|"Yes"| DONE
    STEP3 --> DONE
```

Note: Escalation targets `targetPct`, **not** `sunsetPct`. Items in the sunset queue below `targetPct` continue their countdown undisturbed.

---

## Per-Disk-Group Execution Modes (3.0 Breaking Change)

### The Change

The global `ExecutionMode` on `PreferenceSet` is replaced by a per-disk-group `Mode` field. Each disk group independently runs in its own mode. The global setting becomes `DefaultMode` — used only as the default when new disk groups are auto-discovered.

### Mode Definitions

| Mode | Behavior | Trigger Threshold | Queue / Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`dry-run`** | Log what would be deleted. No actual deletions. | `thresholdPct` | Audit log only |
| **`approval`** | Engine selects candidates → user approves → immediate deletion | `thresholdPct` | `approval_queue` |
| **`auto`** | Engine selects candidates → immediate deletion | `thresholdPct` | `DeletionService` directly |
| **`sunset`** | Engine selects at `sunsetPct` → countdown → gradual deletion. `thresholdPct` is the escalation safety net. | `sunsetPct` (primary), `thresholdPct` (escalation) | `sunset_queue` (new) |

Each mode is self-contained. No conditional logic, no mode-within-a-mode, no overrides.

### Engine Flow Per Mode

```mermaid

    CHECK_MODE{group.Mode?}

    subgraph DRY_RUN["dry-run"]
        DR_THRESH{"usedPct >= thresholdPct?"}

    SU_SUN_THRESH -->|"Yes"| SU_QUEUE
    SU_SUN_THRESH -->|"No"| SU_SKIP
```

### Schema Changes — `DiskGroup` Model

| Column | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | TEXT | `"dry-run"` | Execution mode: `dry-run`, `approval`, `auto`, `sunset`. Stored as TEXT (SQLite has no native ENUM; all constrained string fields in the codebase use TEXT + Go-level validation). |
| `sunset_pct` | REAL | `NULL` | Sunset countdown starts at this %. NULL until explicitly configured by the user. |

**Validation rules:**
- `mode` must be one of `dry-run`, `approval`, `auto`, `sunset` — validated in the service layer.
- When `mode == "sunset"` and `sunset_pct IS NULL`, the engine refuses to evaluate the group and publishes a `sunset_misconfigured` warning event. Sunset never activates with an unconfigured threshold.
- When `mode == "sunset"` and `sunset_pct IS NOT NULL`, enforce `sunsetPct < targetPct < thresholdPct`.
- For all other modes, `sunset_pct` is ignored.

### Schema Changes — `PreferenceSet` Model

| Column | Change | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `execution_mode` | Renamed to `default_mode` | Used only as default for new disk group creation; no longer the runtime mode |

### Migration Path (2.x → 3.0)

1. Add `mode` column to `disk_groups`, defaulting to `"dry-run"`
2. Copy the current `preference_sets.execution_mode` value to every existing `disk_groups.mode` row
3. Rename `execution_mode` to `default_mode` on `preference_sets`
4. API deprecation: the global mode read/write endpoints continue to work for one minor version, proxying to `default_mode`

### Mode Constants

```go
const (
    ModeDryRun   = "dry-run"    // existing
    ModeApproval = "approval"   // existing
    ModeAuto     = "auto"       // existing
    ModeSunset   = "sunset"     // NEW
)
```

### Settings UI

- **"Disk Group Defaults" section:** Default mode selector (dry-run / approval / auto / sunset). Applied when new disk groups are auto-discovered.
- **Each disk group card:** Mode dropdown. When `sunset` is selected, sunset-specific fields appear (`sunsetPct` slider with validation against `targetPct` and `thresholdPct`).
- The global "Running in X mode" banner is replaced by per-group mode indicators on each disk group card.
- A summary line: e.g., "2 groups in approval, 1 in sunset, 1 in dry-run"

## Part 1: Sunset Core

### New `sunset_queue` Table

Sunset items have a fundamentally different lifecycle from approval items and warrant their own table:

| Property | `approval_queue` | `sunset_queue` |
|---|---|---|
| Lifecycle driver | Engine cycle + user action | Time (daily cron) |
| Reconciled per cycle | Yes (`ReconcileQueue()`) | No — persists across cycles |
| Cleared below threshold | Yes (`ClearQueue()`) | No — countdown continues |
| User interaction | Approve / Reject / Snooze / Dismiss | Cancel / Reschedule |
| Expiry mechanism | `snoozed_until` (returns to pending) | `deletion_date` (triggers deletion) |

#### `SunsetQueueItem` Model

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | INTEGER | Primary key |
| `media_name` | TEXT | Item title (indexed) |
| `media_type` | TEXT | movie, show, season, episode, artist, book |
| `tmdb_id` | INTEGER | TMDb ID for media server label application (indexed) |
| `integration_id` | INTEGER | FK to `IntegrationConfig` |
| `external_id` | TEXT | *arr external ID |
| `size_bytes` | INTEGER | File size |
| `score` | REAL | Score at time of scheduling |
| `score_details` | TEXT | JSON-encoded score factors |
| `poster_url` | TEXT | Original poster URL from *arr |
| `disk_group_id` | INTEGER | FK to `DiskGroup` (indexed) |
| `collection_group` | TEXT | Collection deletion group |
| `trigger` | TEXT | `"engine"`, `"user"` |
| `deletion_date` | DATE | When the item should be handed to `DeletionService` |
| `label_applied` | BOOLEAN | Whether the sunset label has been applied to the media server |
| `poster_overlay_active` | BOOLEAN | Whether an overlay poster is currently uploaded |
| `created_at` | DATETIME | When the item entered the sunset queue |
| `updated_at` | DATETIME | Last update |

### `SunsetService`

Manages the `sunset_queue` table lifecycle. Handles countdown tracking, cancellation, rescheduling, expiry processing, escalation, and label management. Does **not** perform deletions — hands items to `DeletionService` when countdowns expire.

Follows the established pattern: accepts `*gorm.DB` and `*events.EventBus` in constructor; registered on `services.Registry` as `reg.Sunset`.

```go
type SunsetService struct {
    db  *gorm.DB
    bus *events.EventBus
}
```

**Key methods:**

```go
// QueueSunset creates a new sunset_queue entry with a deletion_date.
// Also applies the sunset label to the item in all enabled media servers.
func (s *SunsetService) QueueSunset(item db.SunsetQueueItem, deps SunsetDeps) error

// BulkQueueSunset creates multiple sunset entries in a transaction.
// Applies labels to all items in enabled media servers.
func (s *SunsetService) BulkQueueSunset(items []db.SunsetQueueItem, deps SunsetDeps) (int, error)

// Cancel removes a sunset item. Removes the label from media servers.
// Publishes sunset_cancelled event.
func (s *SunsetService) Cancel(entryID uint, deps SunsetDeps) error

// Reschedule updates the deletion_date for a sunset item.
func (s *SunsetService) Reschedule(entryID uint, newDate time.Time) (*db.SunsetQueueItem, error)

// ListForDiskGroup returns all sunset items for a given disk group.
func (s *SunsetService) ListForDiskGroup(diskGroupID uint) ([]db.SunsetQueueItem, error)

// ListAll returns all sunset items across all disk groups, ordered by deletion_date.
func (s *SunsetService) ListAll() ([]db.SunsetQueueItem, error)

// GetExpired returns items where deletion_date <= now.
func (s *SunsetService) GetExpired() ([]db.SunsetQueueItem, error)

// DaysRemaining calculates the countdown for a given sunset item.
func (s *SunsetService) DaysRemaining(item db.SunsetQueueItem) int

// ProcessExpired transitions all expired items to DeletionService.
// Removes labels from media servers. Called by the daily cron job.
func (s *SunsetService) ProcessExpired(deps SunsetDeps) (int, error)

// Escalate force-expires sunset items for a disk group during threshold
// breach. Processes expired first, then oldest-in-queue, freeing only
// enough to reach targetPct. Returns bytes freed.
func (s *SunsetService) Escalate(diskGroupID uint, targetBytes int64, deps SunsetDeps) (int64, error)

// CancelAll cancels all sunset items (emergency button). Returns count removed.
func (s *SunsetService) CancelAll(deps SunsetDeps) (int, error)

// CancelAllForDiskGroup cancels all sunset items for a specific disk group.
func (s *SunsetService) CancelAllForDiskGroup(diskGroupID uint, deps SunsetDeps) (int, error)

// IsSunsetted checks if a media item is already in the sunset queue.
func (s *SunsetService) IsSunsetted(mediaName, mediaType string, diskGroupID uint) bool

// ListSunsettedKeys returns "mediaName|mediaType" keys for O(1) lookups.
func (s *SunsetService) ListSunsettedKeys(diskGroupID uint) (map[string]bool, error)
```

```go
// SunsetDeps holds service dependencies for label management and deletion handoff.
type SunsetDeps struct {
    Integration *IntegrationService
    Deletion    *DeletionService
    Engine      *EngineService
    Settings    SettingsReader
}
```

### Engine Orchestrator Changes

`evaluateAndCleanDisk()` switches on `group.Mode`:

```go
switch group.Mode {
case db.ModeSunset:
    // 1. Check thresholdPct first → escalate (free to targetPct only)
    // 2. Else check sunsetPct → score + queue to sunset_queue + apply labels
case db.ModeAuto:    // unchanged
case db.ModeApproval: // unchanged
default:              // dry-run, unchanged
}
```

For sunset mode specifically:
1. Checks `usedPct >= thresholdPct` → if yes, calls `SunsetService.Escalate()` (frees down to `targetPct` only, preserving the sunset queue)
2. Else checks `usedPct >= sunsetPct` → if yes, scores items, calls `SunsetService.BulkQueueSunset()`
3. Skips items already in the sunset queue via `SunsetService.ListSunsettedKeys()` (same pattern as `ApprovalService.ListSnoozedKeys()`)

### Approval Queue — Untouched

The `approval_queue` table and `ApprovalService` are **completely untouched** by this feature. They continue to serve only disk groups in `approval` mode. No new columns, no new statuses, no conditional branches.

---

## Part 2: Media Server Labels

Instead of Capacitarr creating and managing collections in the media server, a configurable label/tag is applied to sunset items. Users create their own smart collections, filters, or playlists from this label in whatever way their media server supports.

### Why Labels Instead of Managed Collections

| | Managed Collection | Label/Tag |
|---|---|---|
| **Implementation** | 5-method `CollectionManager` + Plex URI scheme + reconciliation service | 2-method `LabelManager` — add and remove |
| **User control** | Capacitarr dictates collection structure | Users build whatever they want from the label |
| **Media server state** | Capacitarr owns a collection object | Labels are atomic per-item — no cross-item state |
| **Reversibility** | Must track collection ID, handle orphans | Remove label, done |
| **Existing codebase** | New interface from scratch | `LabelDataProvider` already reads labels; `LabelManager` adds writes |
| **Daily operations** | Full reconciliation sync on cron | Point-in-time: set on queue entry, remove on cancel/expire |

### `LabelManager` Capability Interface

Added to `internal/integrations/types.go`:

```go
// LabelManager is implemented by media server integrations that can
// add and remove labels/tags on individual media items. Used by
// SunsetService to apply/remove the sunset label.
type LabelManager interface {
    AddLabel(itemID string, label string) error
    RemoveLabel(itemID string, label string) error
}
```

The codebase already has `LabelDataProvider` and `GetLabelMemberships()` for reading labels. `LabelManager` adds write capability to the same integrations.

### Label API Support

| Platform | Add Label | Remove Label | API |
|----------|:-:|:-:|---|
| **Plex** | ✅ | ✅ | `PUT /library/sections/{id}/all?type=1&id={ratingKey}&label[0].tag.tag={label}` (add), `DELETE` variant (remove) |
| **Jellyfin** | ✅ | ✅ | `POST /Items/{id}` with updated `Tags` array |
| **Emby** | ✅ | ✅ | Same as Jellyfin — `POST /Items/{id}` with `Tags` |

### Label Lifecycle

- **On queue entry** (`QueueSunset` / `BulkQueueSunset`): Apply the configured label to the item in all enabled media servers that implement `LabelManager`. Set `label_applied = true` on the queue row.
- **On cancel** (`Cancel`): Remove the label from media servers. Delete the queue row.
- **On expiry** (`ProcessExpired`): Remove the label from media servers before handing the item to `DeletionService`.
- **On escalation** (`Escalate`): Remove the label from media servers before force-deleting.
- **Static label, no churn**: The label is set once when the item enters the queue and removed once when it leaves. There is no daily update cycle for labels (unlike poster overlays which update the countdown text daily).

### Configurable Label Name

| Preference | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SunsetLabel` | `string` | `"capacitarr-sunset"` | The label/tag applied to items in the media server when they enter the sunset queue. Users can change this to any string they prefer. |

If the user changes the label name while items are in the queue, the service should remove the old label and apply the new one (a one-time migration triggered by the preference save).

### Integration Registry Discovery

```go
// LabelManagers returns all registered integrations that implement LabelManager.
func (r *IntegrationRegistry) LabelManagers() []struct {
    ID     uint
    Client LabelManager
}
```

---

## Part 3: Poster Overlays ("Leaving in X Days")

Server-side image composition: download original poster, composite "Leaving in X days" banner, upload modified poster to media server.

### `PosterManager` Capability Interface

```go
type PosterManager interface {
    GetPosterImage(itemID string) (imageData []byte, contentType string, err error)
    UploadPosterImage(itemID string, imageData []byte, contentType string) error
    RestorePosterImage(itemID string) error
}
```

### Poster Upload API Support

| Platform | API |
|----------|---|
| **Plex** | `POST /library/metadata/{ratingKey}/posters` (multipart) |
| **Jellyfin** | `POST /Items/{itemId}/Images/Primary` (base64 body) |
| **Emby** | `POST /Items/{id}/Images/{Type}` (base64 body) |

### `internal/poster/` Package

```
internal/poster/
├── overlay.go       — image composition (image/draw + x/image/font)
├── overlay_test.go
├── cache.go         — original poster caching (filesystem)
└── cache_test.go
```

- Composite gradient banner at bottom (Netflix-style)
- Bundled SIL-licensed font (Inter or Noto Sans), ~5-15 MB
- Cache originals in `/config/posters/originals/` keyed by `{integrationID}_{tmdbID}_{hash}.jpg`

### Daily Poster Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CRON as Daily Cron
    participant SUNSET as SunsetService
    participant POSTER as PosterOverlayService
    participant CACHE as Poster Cache
    participant MEDIA as Media Server

    CRON->>SUNSET: ListAll()
    SUNSET-->>CRON: items with days_remaining
    loop Each item where posterOverlayEnabled=true
        CRON->>POSTER: UpdateOverlay(item, daysRemaining)
        alt No cached original
            POSTER->>MEDIA: GetPosterImage(itemID)
            POSTER->>CACHE: Store original
        end
        POSTER->>POSTER: Composite "Leaving in X days"
        POSTER->>MEDIA: UploadPosterImage(overlayBytes)
    end
```

### Poster Restoration

On cancel, expiry, or escalation: restore original from cache → upload → delete cache file. "Restore All Posters" emergency button in settings UI. Startup validation warns if cached originals are missing.

    } else if processed > 0 {
        slog.Info("Processed expired sunset items", "count", processed)
    }

    // 2. Update poster overlays (if enabled)
    prefs, _ := reg.Settings.GetPreferences()
    if prefs.PosterOverlayEnabled {
        reg.PosterOverlay.UpdateAll(reg.Sunset, reg.Integration)
    }
})
```

## REST API Endpoints

```
GET    /api/v1/sunset-queue          — list all sunset items with countdown
DELETE /api/v1/sunset-queue/:id       — cancel a sunset item
PATCH  /api/v1/sunset-queue/:id       — reschedule (change deletion date)
POST   /api/v1/sunset-queue/clear     — cancel all sunset items
```

## Dashboard UX

- New `SunsetQueueCard.vue` on the dashboard (parallel to `SnoozedItemsCard`)
- Shows items with countdown timers ("Leaving in X days"), cancel/reschedule buttons
- Backed by `useSunsetQueue.ts` composable with SSE subscriptions
- Only populates when sunset items exist

## Phased Implementation

### Phase 1: Per-Disk-Group Modes + Sunset Core + Labels

**Goal:** Execution mode moves to per-disk-group. Sunset mode is available. Items enter a countdown, labels are applied to media server items, escalation works with `targetPct` ceiling.

#### Schema Changes

1. New table: `sunset_queue`
2. Add to `disk_groups`: `mode` (TEXT, default `"dry-run"`), `sunset_pct` (REAL, default `NULL`)
3. Rename on `preference_sets`: `execution_mode` → `default_mode`; add `sunset_days`, `sunset_label`, `poster_overlay_enabled`
4. Data migration: copy current `execution_mode` to all existing `disk_groups.mode`

#### New Files

```
backend/internal/db/models.go              — SunsetQueueItem model (in same file as other models)
backend/internal/services/sunset.go        — SunsetService
backend/internal/services/sunset_test.go

```

#### Modified Files

```
backend/internal/db/models.go              — ModeSunset constant, DiskGroup.Mode/SunsetPct, PreferenceSet.DefaultMode rename + sunset prefs
backend/internal/services/registry.go      — Add Sunset to Registry
backend/internal/integrations/types.go     — Add LabelManager interface
backend/internal/integrations/plex.go      — LabelManager implementation
backend/internal/integrations/jellyfin.go  — LabelManager implementation
backend/internal/integrations/emby.go      — LabelManager implementation
backend/internal/integrations/registry.go  — Add LabelManagers()
backend/internal/events/types.go           — Sunset + label events
backend/internal/jobs/cron.go              — Daily sunset tick
backend/internal/poller/evaluate.go        — Switch on group.Mode; sunset threshold; escalation to targetPct
backend/routes/api.go                      — Register sunset route group
backend/routes/settings.go                 — DefaultMode rename; disk group mode endpoints
frontend/                                  — Disk group mode selector; SunsetQueueCard; mode indicators
```

#### Steps

1. Add `ModeSunset` constant alongside existing `ModeDryRun`/`ModeApproval`/`ModeAuto`
2. Add `Mode`, `SunsetPct` columns to `DiskGroup` model
3. Rename `ExecutionMode` to `DefaultMode` on `PreferenceSet`; add sunset preference fields (`SunsetDays`, `SunsetLabel`, `PosterOverlayEnabled`)
4. Write data migration: copy global `execution_mode` to all existing `disk_groups.mode`
5. Create `SunsetQueueItem` model
6. Add validation: `sunsetPct < targetPct < thresholdPct` when `mode == "sunset"`; reject if `sunsetPct IS NULL`
7. Create `SunsetService` with full lifecycle methods (including label application/removal)
8. Create `LabelManager` capability interface
9. Implement `LabelManager` on `PlexClient`, `JellyfinClient`, `EmbyClient`
10. Add `LabelManagers()` to `IntegrationRegistry`
11. Add new event types
12. Wire `SunsetService` into `services.Registry`
13. Modify `evaluateAndCleanDisk()`: switch on `group.Mode`, add sunset branch with `sunsetPct` evaluation + escalation ladder (free to `targetPct` only)
14. Add daily cron job for sunset expiry processing
15. Create REST API endpoints in `routes/sunset.go`
16. Update settings routes: `DefaultMode` rename, disk group mode PATCH, sunset label preference
17. Add notification support for new events
18. Build frontend: disk group mode selector in settings, sunset-specific fields conditional on mode, `SunsetQueueCard.vue`, `useSunsetQueue.ts`, mode indicators per disk group card
19. Unit tests for `SunsetService` (in-memory SQLite pattern)
20. Integration tests for label management per media server

### Phase 2: Poster Overlays

**Goal:** Sunset items display "Leaving in X days" on their poster in the media server.

```

#### Steps

1. Add `PosterManager` capability interface
2. Implement `PosterManager` on `PlexClient`, `JellyfinClient`, `EmbyClient`
3. Add `PosterManagers()` to `IntegrationRegistry`
4. Create `internal/poster/overlay.go` — image composition
5. Create `internal/poster/cache.go` — filesystem-based original caching
6. Create `PosterOverlayService`
7. Add poster overlay step to daily cron (after sunset expiry processing)
8. Add poster restoration to `Cancel()`, `ProcessExpired()`, `Escalate()`
9. Add "Restore All Posters" emergency button in settings
10. Add startup validation for cached originals
11. Unit tests (fixture-based image composition)
12. Integration tests per media server

## Related Future Work (Separate Plans)

### Per-Disk-Group Scoring Weight Overrides

Custom rules are currently per-integration; scoring factor weights are global. With per-disk-group modes, users may want different scoring priorities per group (e.g., weight file size heavily on a small SSD but lightly on a large NAS).

**Recommended approach:** Each disk group can optionally override global factor weights. Rules stay per-integration. A new `disk_group_weight_overrides` table with `(disk_group_id, factor_key, weight)` tuples. The engine merges global weights with per-group overrides before calling the evaluator. This is independent of sunset and should be planned separately.

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Resolution | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Execution mode scope** | Per-disk-group `Mode` field | Eliminates global-vs-per-group conflicts; each group is self-contained |
| **Sunset data storage** | Dedicated `sunset_queue` table | Different lifecycle from approval queue; avoids behavioral complexity |
| **Service naming** | `SunsetService` | Manages transition period, not deletion |
| **Threshold ordering** | `sunsetPct < targetPct < thresholdPct` | Escalation frees to `targetPct` only, preserving sunset queue below |
| **Media server visibility** | Labels/tags via `LabelManager` (not managed collections) | Simpler; users control display; no cross-item state; existing `LabelDataProvider` pattern |
| **Sunset label** | Static, configurable, default `"capacitarr-sunset"` | Set once on entry, removed on exit; no daily churn; namespaced |
| **Poster overlay** | Server-side image composition | Full visual control; Go stdlib mature |
| **Poster cache** | Filesystem (`/config/posters/originals/`) | Avoids SQLite BLOBs |
| **Multi-server** | Labels + overlays applied to ALL enabled media servers | Users may have Plex + Jellyfin |
| **Font** | Bundled SIL-licensed (Inter or Noto Sans) | i18n support; ~5 MB |
| **Overlay frequency** | Daily | Appropriate for 30-day countdown cadence |
| **Per-disk-group rules** | Deferred to separate plan | Independent of sunset; scoring works correctly with global weights |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **3.0 breaking change** — per-disk-group modes | High | Data migration seeds existing groups with current global mode; API deprecation period; clear upgrade docs |
| **Poster corruption** | High | Cache originals before upload; `poster_overlay_active` flag; "Restore All Posters" emergency button |
| **Disk fills during sunset window** | High | Escalation ladder frees to `targetPct` only; `thresholdPct` is always the safety net |
| **Media server API breakage** | Medium | Integration tests; graceful degradation |
| **Performance at scale** | Medium | Batch label operations; poster composition once/day |
| **Label rename while items queued** | Low | On preference save, remove old label and apply new one across all sunset items |
| **TMDb ID matching gaps** | Low | Existing pattern: items without TMDb IDs skipped |
| **Write operations to media servers** | Low | Labels are atomic per-item; trivially reversible |
| **Race condition with user poster edits** | Low | Content hash comparison; re-cache if changed |
