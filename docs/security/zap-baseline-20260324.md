## Warnings

| Rule ID | Test | Result | Details |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 100001 | Unexpected Content-Type | ⚠️ WARN | 14 instances — SPA fallback returns `text/html` for unknown paths (including cloud metadata probe paths like `/computeMetadata/v1/`, `/latest/meta-data/`, `/metadata/instance`, `/metadata/v1`, `/opc/v1/instance/`, `/opc/v2/instance/`). This is expected behavior: Vue Router handles client-side routing, so the server returns the SPA shell for any unrecognized path. Not a security issue. |

## Informational Alerts (No Action Required)

| Alert | Risk Level | Instances | Notes |
|-------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Client Error response code (401, 404) | Informational | 5 | Expected — unauthenticated API requests correctly return 401 Unauthorized; cloud metadata probe `/openstack/latest/meta_data.json` returns 404 |
| Non-Storable Content | Informational | 1 | 401 responses are correctly non-cacheable |

## Comparison with Previous Scan (2026-03-23)

| Metric | 2026-03-23 | 2026-03-24 | Change |
