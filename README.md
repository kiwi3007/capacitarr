# Capacitarr

[![GitLab Container Registry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Container_Registry-GitLab-orange?logo=gitlab)](https://gitlab.com/starshadow/software/capacitarr/container_registry)

**Intelligent media library capacity manager for the *arr ecosystem.**

Capacitarr integrates with your *arr apps, media servers, and request managers to automatically manage disk capacity. When disk space runs low, it scores every media item across multiple dimensions — watch history, recency, file size, ratings, age, and series status — then removes the least-valuable items first. A visual rule builder lets you protect specific content from ever being deleted.

## Features

- **Intelligent Scoring Engine** — Six weighted factors rank every media item for deletion priority
- **Cascading Rule Builder** — Visual rule builder with `always_keep`, `prefer_keep`, `prefer_delete`, and `always_delete` actions
- **Multi-Integration Support** — Connects to Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Overseerr, and Tautulli
- **Disk Group Monitoring** — Tracks capacity across multiple disk groups with configurable thresholds
- **Real-Time Updates** — Server-Sent Events (SSE) push engine state, deletions, and activity to the browser instantly — no polling
- **Approval Queue** — Review and approve deletion candidates before they are removed, with snooze and bulk operations
- **Score Transparency** — Full per-item score breakdowns showing each factor's contribution
- **Complete Audit Trail** — Separate approval queue (state machine) and audit log (permanent deletion history)
- **39 Activity Event Types** — Every user-visible action is tracked and streamable via SSE
- **Notifications** — Discord, Slack, and in-app notifications driven by the event bus
- **Themeable UI** — Light/dark mode with customizable accent colors, 22 languages
- **Reverse Proxy Ready** — Subdirectory deployments, proxy authentication (Authelia, Authentik, Organizr), SSE-compatible
- **Single Container** — Go backend + Nuxt 4 frontend + SQLite database in one Docker image
- **PUID/PGID Support** — Runs as any user/group for proper volume permissions

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  capacitarr:
    image: registry.gitlab.com/starshadow/software/capacitarr:stable
    container_name: capacitarr
    ports:
      - "2187:2187"
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - JWT_SECRET=change-me-to-a-random-string
    volumes:
      - capacitarr-config:/config
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:2187/api/v1/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      start_period: 15s
      retries: 3
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  capacitarr-config:
```

Start the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:2187` in your browser. On first launch, you will be prompted to create an admin account.

## Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables. Every variable is optional — sensible defaults are used when not set.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `2187` | HTTP listen port |
| `BASE_URL` | `/` | Base URL path for subdirectory reverse proxy deployments |
| `DB_PATH` | `/config/capacitarr.db` | SQLite database file path |
| `DEBUG` | `false` | Enable debug logging and permissive CORS |
| `JWT_SECRET` | *(auto-generated)* | Secret for signing JWT tokens. Set for persistent sessions across restarts |
| `SECURE_COOKIES` | `false` | Enable the `Secure` flag on cookies (set `true` for HTTPS) |
| `AUTH_HEADER` | *(none)* | Trusted reverse proxy auth header (e.g. `Remote-User`, `X-authentik-username`) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | *(none)* | Comma-separated allowed CORS origins |
| `PUID` | `1000` | User ID for the container process *(Docker only)* |
| `PGID` | `1000` | Group ID for the container process *(Docker only)* |

> **⚠️ AUTH_HEADER Security:** Only enable `AUTH_HEADER` when Capacitarr is exclusively accessible through your reverse proxy. If the server is directly reachable, any client can forge this header and bypass authentication.

For the complete configuration reference including subdirectory deployment and proxy authentication examples, see the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md).

## Architecture Overview

Capacitarr is a single-container application that bundles a Go backend, a Nuxt 4 (Vue 3) frontend, and a SQLite database. The frontend is statically generated at build time and embedded into the Go binary via `go:embed`, producing a single self-contained executable.

The backend uses a **service layer** pattern — all business logic lives in injectable services, not in route handlers. A typed **event bus** publishes 39 event types that drive activity logging, notifications, and real-time UI updates via **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.

## Scoring Algorithm

Capacitarr uses a two-layer system to decide which items to remove:

1. **Preference-based scoring** — Each item is scored across six weighted factors (0–10 weight per factor). Higher score = more likely to be deleted.
2. **Protection rules** — Override scores with `always_keep`, `prefer_keep`, `prefer_delete`, or `always_delete` actions based on conditions like genre, tag, quality profile, or rating.

### Scoring Factors

| Factor | What It Measures | High Score Means |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Watch History** | Play count | Unwatched → delete first |
| **Last Watched** | Time since last play | Watched long ago → delete first |
| **File Size** | Disk space consumed | Larger files → delete first |
| **Rating** | Community/critic rating | Low-rated → delete first |
| **Time in Library** | How long the item has been in the library | Older items → delete first |
| **Series Status** | Series status (continuing vs. ended) | Ended shows → delete first |

Each factor's contribution is normalized against the total configured weight, producing a final score between 0.0 (keep) and 1.0 (delete). Protection rules then apply modifiers or absolute overrides to the calculated score.

For the complete scoring algorithm documentation, see the [Scoring Guide](docs/scoring.md).

## Development Setup

Development uses Docker Compose to build and run the application in a container that mirrors production:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/starshadow/software/capacitarr.git
cd capacitarr

# Build and start the container
docker compose up --build

# Or run in detached mode
docker compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Tear down
docker compose down
```

The container exposes port **2187** and serves both the Go backend API and the Nuxt 4 frontend.
